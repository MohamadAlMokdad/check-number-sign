# Positive, Negative, or Zero Checker ⚖️

This Python program takes a number input from the user and checks whether it is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**. It performs basic validation to ensure the user enters a valid number (integer or floating-point), and handles errors for invalid input.

## 🚀 Features
- Checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.
- Handles both **integer** and **floating-point** numbers.
- Provides error handling for invalid inputs.

## 💻 Usage

1. **Input**: The program will prompt you to enter a number (integer or floating-point). For example:
    ```
    Please enter a number: -5
    ```

2. **Output**: After processing the input, the output will be one of the following:
    ```
    -5.0 is a negative number.
    ```

### Example Run:

```bash
Please enter a number: 7
7.0 is a positive number.
